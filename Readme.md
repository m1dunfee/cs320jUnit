•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are the cornerstone of software development. As developers, we build systems to meet their specifications. Understanding user requirements is essential from the very beginning of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). You can think of user input as the source of a river, shaping the direction of development. Testing, then, acts like the riverbanks—ensuring the flow stays on course and the outcome matches the user’s intent. Continuous validation and iteration based on user feedback are key to building meaningful software.

•	How do I approach designing software?

I prefer a top-down approach. I enjoy planning and believe the SDLC is one of the most valuable frameworks we study. It teaches us to anticipate challenges and structure our process—but we also need to recognize the limits of planning. There's always a balance between idealism and reality. Overanalyzing can lead to paralysis, so it’s better to adopt a mindset of “fail early, fail often.” The goal isn’t perfection—it's progress. Sometimes the best approach is to aim for "just barely good enough" and iterate from there. Success lives in the delta between planning and adaptability.
